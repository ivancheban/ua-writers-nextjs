Docusaurus is a static-site generator that helps you ship beautiful documentation sites in no time. It's built using React, which makes it highly extensible.

### Installation

To get started, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

This will scaffold a new project in a directory called my-website.

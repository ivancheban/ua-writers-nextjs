> The **docs-as-code** approach is a philosophy that encourages writers and developers to manage documentation using the same tools and workflows that they use for source code. This means leveraging version control systems like Git, writing in plain text formats like Markdown, and running automated checks.

### Key Benefits

- **Version Control**: Every change is tracked. You can revert to previous versions and see a full history.
- **Collaboration**: Teams can collaborate on documentation using pull requests and code reviews, just like they do with code.
- **Automation**: You can automate builds, tests, and deployments for your documentation site.
